# NEXRAD to ODIM HDF5 files

A short script for transforming NEXRAD Level 2 files to ODIM HDF5 file format.
The output file should be more-or-less v2.2. compliant, but nothing is guaranteed.
The output filename is the same as the input filename, but with the extension changed to .h5.

The code for saving the data to ODIM HDF5 is modified from the [xradar.io](https://github.com/openradar/xradar) module.

Requirements:

- xarray
- pyart
- xradar

## Usage

```bash

python nexrad_to_odim.py <input-folder-path>

```
